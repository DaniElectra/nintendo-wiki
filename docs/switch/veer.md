title: Veer (Vendor Weights)
---

Title content is provided by three different vendors: akamai, llnw and lumen. The veer server provides a policy that assigns a weight to each vendor. The higher the weight for a vendor, the higher the probability that the Switch downloads the content from that vendor.

The veer server was introduced in system version 14.0.0 and only accepts requests with a valid device certificate.
