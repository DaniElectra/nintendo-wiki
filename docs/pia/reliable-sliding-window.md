title: Reliable Sliding Window
---

The reliable sliding window ensures that all packets arrive and in the correct order. Large messages are fragmented. The reliable sliding window is used by the following protocols:

* [Mesh protocol](/docs/pia/mesh)
* Session protocol
* [Reliable protocol](/docs/pia/reliable)
* [Broadcast reliable protocol](/docs/pia/broadcast-reliable)
* [Stream broadcast reliable protocol](/docs/pia/stream-broadcast-reliable)

When a reliable sliding window is used, messages are wrapped as follows:

*Up to 5.12:*
