title: Stream Broadcast Reliable
---

The stream broadcast reliable protocol is meant for larger data streams. A console can request a certain data stream from another console, after which the other console will start transmitting the stream. A [reliable sliding window](/docs/pia/reliable-sliding-window) is used to ensure that all packets arrive in the correct order.

The payload contains the following data:

| Offset | Size | Description                  |
|--------|------|------------------------------|
| 0x0    | 1    | [Packet type](#packet-types) |
| 0x1    | 1    | Requested stream id          |
| 0x2    | 1    | Progress (in %)              |
| 0x3    | 4    | Requested stream size        |
| 0x7    | 4    | Payload size                 |
| 0xB    |      | Payload                      |

### Packet Types

| Type | Description      |
