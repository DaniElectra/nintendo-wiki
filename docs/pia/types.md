This page describes common data structures that are used by the Pia library.

1. [InetAddress](#inetaddress)
2. [StationAddress](#stationaddress)
3. [StationLocation](#stationlocation)
4. [StationConnectionInfo](#stationconnectioninfo)
5. [ReliableSlidingWindow](#reliableslidingwindow)

The following ids are used in various places:

1. [Constant id](#constant-id)
2. [Variable id](#variable-id)
3. [Service variable id](#service-variable-id)

## InetAddress
*Up to 5.10:*

This structure can only represent IPv4 addresses.

| Offset | Size | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| 0x0    | 4    | Address     |
| 0x4    | 2    | Port        |

*5.11 - 6.30:*

This structure can represent both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Which encoding is used depends on the context.

| Offset | Size       | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| 0x0    | 0, 4 or 16 | Address     |
| 0x10   | 2          | Port        |

## StationAddress
*Up to 4.10:*

| Offset | Size | Description                  |
|--------|------|------------------------------|
| 0x0    | 6    | [Inet address](#inetaddress) |
| 0x6    | 2    | Extension id                 |

*5.2 - 5.44:*

| Offset | Size       | Description                  |
|--------|------------|------------------------------|
| 0x0    | 2, 6 or 18 | [Inet address](#inetaddress) |

*6.16 - 6.30:*

| Offset | Size | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| 0x0    | 16   | Address     |
| 0x10   | 2    | Port        |

## StationLocation
The station location holds information that allows Pia to connect to a given station. Many fields are directly taken from a [station url](/docs/nex/types#stationurl), when NEX is used.

*Up to 4.10:*

| Type                              | Description                            |

### NEX URL Type
The URL type depends on the scheme of the given station url. It is always 0 or 1 in practice.

| Value | Scheme   |
| ----- | -------- |
| 0     | Invalid  |
| 1     | `prudp`  |
| 2     | `prudps` |
| 3     | `udp`    |

### NAT Mapping

| Value | Description                  |
|-------|------------------------------|
| 0     | Unknown                      |
| 1     | Endpoint independent mapping |
| 2     | Endpoint dependent mapping   |

### NAT Filtering

| Value | Description                |
|-------|----------------------------|
| 0     | Unknown                    |
| 1     | Port independent filtering |
| 2     | Port dependent filtering   |

### NAT Flags

| Flag | Description   |
|------|---------------|
| 1    | Is behind NAT |
| 2    | Is public     |

### NAT Type

The NAT type determines how well the Switch is able to set up peer-to-peer connections. A is the best and F is the worst. The NAT type is also shown in the system settings if you perform a connection test.

The NAT type is used during host migration, giving players with a better NAT type a higher priority.

| Value | Type |
|-------|------|
| 0     | F    |
| 1     | A    |
| 2     | B    |
| 3     | C    |
| 4     | D    |

## StationConnectionInfo
*Up to 5.9:*

| Type                                | Description      |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| [StationLocation](#stationlocation) | Public location  |
| [StationLocation](#stationlocation) | Private location |

In Pia version 5.10, the station connection info structure was removed.

## ReliableSlidingWindow
A reliable sliding window is used by various protocols to ensure that all messages arrive in the correct order. Large messages are fragmented. When a reliable sliding window is used, messages are wrapped as follows:

*Up to 5.12:*

| Offset | Size | Description            |
| ------ | ---- | ---------------------- |
| 0x0    | 2    | [Flags](#flags)        |

## Flags

2. [Constant id](#constant-id)
3. [Variable id](#variable-id)
4. [Service variable id](#service-variable-id)

## Constant ID
The constant id uniquely identifies a station, and never changes, even across sessions. The constant id depends on the network type.

**NEX** *(Up to 5.44):*

The constant id is the same as your principal id (pid).

**LAN** *(Up to 5.9):*

The constant id is generated from your local IP address and port: `ip << 32 | port`

**LDN** *(Up to 5.9):*

The constant id is generated from your MAC address: `mac[2] << 56 | mac[4] << 48 | mac[5] << 40 | mac[3] << 32 | mac[1] << 24 | mac[0] << 16`.

## Variable ID
The variable id uniquely identifies a station in the current session. Unlike the [constant id](#constant-id), it may change across sessions. The variable id depends on the network type:

**NEX** *(Up to 5.44):*

The variable id is the same as your connection id (CID).

**LAN** *(Up to 5.9):*

The variable is set to the current system tick (`nn::os::GetSystemTick()`) at the start of the session.

**LDN** *(Up to 5.9):*

The variable is set to the current system tick (`nn::os::GetSystemTick()`) at the start of the session.

## Service Variable ID
Like the [variable id](#variable-id), the service variable id uniquely identifies a station in the current session and may change across sessions. The service variable id depends on the network type:

**NEX** *(Up to 5.44):*

The services variable id is your Rendez-Vous connection id (RVCID). This is received from the server when the client registers itself with the [secure connection protocol](/docs/nex/protocols/secure-connection).

**LAN** *(Up to 5.9):*

The service variable id is generated from your local IP address and port: `(ip & 0xFFFF) << 16 | port`.

**LDN** *(Up to 5.9):*

The service variable id is the CRC32 hash of your MAC address.

[Constant id]: #constant-id
[Variable id]: #variable-id
[Service variable id]: #service-variable-id
